This is my first repository!

Hello! My name is Garrett Harris and I am learning GitHub via "GitHub for Dummies".

I graduated from UGA with a Sports Management degree. 
My younger passion for sports has become beset by an avid passion for technology.

I am learning to program via HarvardX CS50x, FreeCodeCamp, and other free resources.

Currently, I work as the accounting manager for a telematics installation company in the USA.
